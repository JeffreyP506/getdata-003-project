# Things I do
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

# File description
## run_analysis.R
By running this R script with downloaded dataset in the same directory, you'll get the tidy data.

TIP: Be sure put change your working directory to where you put these two files.
